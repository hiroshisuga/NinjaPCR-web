NinjaPCR needs WiFi, but that doesn't mean it have to be connected to internet.

If you want to run console localy without [our online console](http://ninjapcr.tori.st/console/), it's quite easy to setup internal server for your own.

1. Clone or download this project to your pc by hitting "Clone or download" button on top-right of [github page](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaPCR-web).
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if not yet installed.
3. Open terminal and change directory to the one you copied at step1.
4. Run "node app.js"
5. Access [http://localhost:3000/console](http://localhost:3000/console). 

Any devices in same network can use that console at http://(ip of your pc):3000/console if port 3000 is open.
